# Analyzing price of used cars

When analzing and predicting the price of a used car, there are a lot of factors in play. It is known that some cars increase in value as they age while most devalue with age. We're trying to evaluate the various features that affect the price of a used car. 

Looking at the initial dataset available, we see that there are a lot of records with junk for data that skew the data by quite a bit.

As are considering used cars and most used cars that sell aren't of the ultra premium kind we're going to limit ourselves to cars under $100,000 and see how the mean price is distributed with the condition of the cars.
