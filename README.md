# Analyzing price of used cars

When analzing and predicting the price of a used car, there are a lot of factors in play. It is known that some cars increase in value as they age while most devalue with age. We're trying to evaluate the various features that affect the price of a used car. 

Looking at the initial dataset available, we see that there are a lot of records with junk for data that skew the data by quite a bit.

As are considering used cars and most used cars that sell aren't of the ultra premium kind we're going to limit ourselves to cars under $100,000 and see how the mean price is distributed with the condition of the cars.

We can look at various factors of the used car and see how the prices are distributed. Just taking a look at all the models and the mean of their prices we can see brands carry a good resale value and what cars a dealership can consider carrying in stock. We can see that some brands like Land Rover might have a high premium value intially but their value is quite low as a used vehicle.

If we look at another feature, this time color, we see that initially it doesn't look like it plays a big factor when it comes to the selling price.
